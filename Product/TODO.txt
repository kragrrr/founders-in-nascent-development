Some of the best founders are hidden in plain sight. They’re not posting on LinkedIn — they’re heads down building. They’re scale-up veterans whose options are vesting. Migrants building quiet empires. PhD researchers with IP ready to spin out.

We want you to help us find and map them.

🧠 The Challenge

Build a searchable database of under-the-radar founder talent. Your product should help surface high-potential current and future founders across Australia.

Must include fields for:

Name

LinkedIn

City

Startup name (if applicable)

Tags (e.g. “scale-up alum,” “side project builder,” “PhD researcher,” “migrant founder”)

Diversity measures:

Required: Gender, Ethnicity

Optional: LGBTQI+, Neurodivergent, Age, Migrant status

🔎 Suggested Data Sources

You're free to be creative, but here are a few to start:

LinkedIn (roles, career trajectories, side project links)

Community groups (Slack/Discords, meetup lists, university clubs)

Crunchbase (stealth startups, early stage company staff)

University and research websites

Founder Twitter/X, Product Hunt, GitHub

You can scrape, research, or crowdsource — as long as the end product is insightful and usable.

🧑‍⚖️ Judging

Projects will be judged by the Techstars team based on:

Data insight and quality

Filterable, usable UX

Creativity in uncovering non-obvious talent

🧠 Prompt Inspiration

Think:

4-year scale-up engineer ready to jump

PhD close to finishing, researching AI, bio, or deeptech

SMB operator now launching SaaS tools

Hackathon winners not yet “in the ecosystem”

Migrant entrepreneurs running businesses under the radar

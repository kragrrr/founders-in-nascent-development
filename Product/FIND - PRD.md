# FIND : Founders in Nascent Development - Product Requirements Document

This PRD outlines the development of a comprehensive talent discovery platform designed to identify and catalog high-potential current and future founders across Australia's startup ecosystem. The platform will aggregate data from multiple sources to create a searchable database that surfaces under-the-radar entrepreneurial talent, with particular focus on diversity and inclusion metrics. By leveraging AI-powered search capabilities through Perplexity's Sonar API and sophisticated data scraping techniques, the platform aims to democratize founder discovery and provide valuable insights into Australia's emerging entrepreneurial landscape.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Australia's startup ecosystem faces a critical challenge in identifying and connecting with high-potential entrepreneurial talent before they become widely recognized. Current founder discovery methods rely heavily on existing networks, public funding announcements, and established startup databases, creating significant blind spots for early-stage entrepreneurs, diverse founders, and those building outside traditional tech hubs.

This talent discovery gap particularly affects underrepresented groups including women, ethnic minorities, migrants, and founders operating in regional areas or emerging sectors. Traditional venture capital and accelerator programs often miss promising entrepreneurs who haven't yet entered the formal startup ecosystem but demonstrate strong entrepreneurial potential through their backgrounds, projects, and career trajectories[^6].

### Vision and Goals

The FIND aims to revolutionize how investors, accelerators, and startup communities identify promising entrepreneurial talent by creating Australia's most comprehensive database of current and future founders. The platform will surface hidden gems in the entrepreneurial landscape through intelligent data aggregation, AI-powered insights, and sophisticated search capabilities.

**Primary Objectives:**

- Build a searchable database containing 10,000+ Australian entrepreneur profiles within the first year
- Achieve 40% representation of underrepresented groups in the database
- Provide actionable insights through AI-powered analysis and trend identification
- Enable users to discover founders 6-12 months before they appear in traditional startup databases
- Create standardized diversity metrics that promote inclusive founder discovery


### Success Criteria

- **Database Growth:** 1,000 new profiles added monthly with 95% data accuracy
- **User Engagement:** 500+ monthly active users performing 2,000+ searches
- **Discovery Success Rate:** 70% of identified "high-potential" founders launch ventures within 18 months
- **Diversity Metrics:** Maintain 50/50 gender representation and 35% ethnic minority representation
- **API Performance:** <500ms average response time for search queries
- **Data Freshness:** 90% of profiles updated within 90 days

        }
    
    def collect_founder_data(self, search_criteria):
        results = []
        for source, scraper in self.scrapers.items():
            try:
                data = scraper.scrape(search_criteria)
                results.extend(self.normalize_data(data, source))
            except Exception as e:
                self.log_error(f"Scraping error for {source}: {e}")
        
        return self.merge_duplicate_profiles(results)
```


### AI-Powered Data Enrichment

    Provide insights on:
    1. Entrepreneurial readiness indicators
    2. Industry expertise and market knowledge
    3. Leadership and execution capabilities
    4. Network and resource access
    5. Risk factors and potential challenges
    """
    
    response = await sonar_client.search(
        query=sonar_query,
        max_citations=15,
        search_focus="comprehensive_analysis"
    )
    
    return extract_structured_insights(response)
```

**Search Functionality:**

```javascript
// Search interface with real-time filtering
const SearchInterface = () => {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
    location: [],
    tags: [],
    diversity: {},
    experience: ''
  });
  
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const performSearch = async (query) => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await api.searchFounders({
        query,
        filters,
        limit: 50,
        offset: 0
      });
      setResults(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Search failed:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <SearchDashboard
      onSearch={performSearch}
      filters={filters}
      onFilterChange={setFilters}
      results={results}
      loading={loading}
    />
